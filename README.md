# Adult-Census-Income-Classification
Project Overview

This project analyzes socio-economic factors affecting income levels using the Adult Census Income dataset. The primary objective was to develop predictive models that classify individuals into two income categories: earning â‰¤ $50,000 annually or > $50,000 annually, based on demographic and employment data.
